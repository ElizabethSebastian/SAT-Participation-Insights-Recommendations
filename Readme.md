### Project Statement

 In 2017, the SAT had an average participation rate of 20% when compared to ACT of 65%. This subsequently changed to 46% and 62% respectively in 2018. Despite SAT becoming increasingly popular, ACT still remains the majority choice of states. 

### Executive Summary

ACT was popular than SAT among US states for 2014-15 and in 2010 College Board started to think about strategies to increase SAT participation among the individual states.
An aggregate data set of SAT and ACT from 2017 an 2018 is analysed to come up with some solutions. 

ACT and SAT distribution roughly complements each other which suggests that states may be able to choose between either of the test. ACT has close to 20 states with high participation rates which is close to 100% and around 5 states with low participation rate less than 10%. SAT on the other hand had close to 20 states with participation rates less than 10% and most of the other states with arund 60% participation rate.

Both ACT and SAT scores are strongly negatively correlated with respect to their participation rates since low participation means a group of selective people who are high scorers and high participation rates suggests diluted talents.
The policies of each states affect the participation rates of each tests and it can be noticed that many states prefers one particular test among the two.

SAT made clear gains in 2018 when compared with 2017 where the overall difference in mean state participation rate in 2018 vs 2017 is higher and more state policies choose SAT over ACT. Illinois and Colorado made a significant change from low participation rate close to 10% in 2017 to close to 100% in 2018 and the overall participation gains of SAT is mainly contributed by those states. It is also observed that there are 20 sates with <20% SAT participation rate in 2018. Those are the potential states where significant changes can change the overall SAT participation rates. After opting out the states where ACT is compulsory and after sorting by the number of high school graduates, Minnesota is chosen to be the best fit to target. It would be a better strategy for the College Board to invest in Minnesota which would be a promising opportunity to impact the SAT paticipation rates.

### Conclusions and Recommendations

ACT and SAT distribution roughly complements each other with states mandate either one of  them.  ACT being the popular test, there are 20 states with greater than 80% participation in ACT, compared to 12 states with greater than 80% for SAT. Despite SAT getting popular ACT still remains the majority chice of states. 

Among 20 states with low SAT participation rates in 2018, Minnesota was chosen to be the target state because the state policies do not mandate either SAT or ACT and it is a large state with high population of high school students. 

Some proposals are made to the College Board to be implemented in Minnesota which can help to increase the SAT participation rates. It would be a better strategy for the College Board to work with the state and encorage state administration of SAT where SAT is make compulsory at state's expense. SAT School Day program can also be introduced which helps to increase the accesibility of SAT and provide financial aid. Collage Board can also work with colleges to provide required tuition/assistance to high school students inorder to help students with the transition.

With all the recommendation taken into acton, SAT participation in Minnesota can be increased significantly. Such a change in Minnesota which is a large state with high educational background, can influnce other states also to make such transition.
